> A Simple implementation for securing Rest API's with FaceBook Signed Request


## Rest Securing

1. Run the Spring boot application
2. Go to <http://localhost:8080/index.html>
     * This page mocks any client or a webpage that will potentially consume the Rest API
3. Use the bearer token displayed on the page in the Authorization header of your Rest calls.
